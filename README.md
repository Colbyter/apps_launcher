# Apps_launcher
Simple CLI tool to automatically launch/close various Apps on Mac.

I made this tool to automate some daily routine at work. It just launches some of Apps I use on daily basis at work.

The script can be amended to work on *NIX platform.

`python apps_launcher.py --help` - To get to the help menu

`python apps_launcher.py -state ON (to launch the apps)/OFF (to quit them)`
